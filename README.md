# Conformtabler

Small Go app for generating table of available formatters for [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim).

## Motivation

This project is inspired by [mason-lspconfig](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) and [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint).
Despite the fact conforms repository has a list of formatters I find it easier to use a table for such purpose.
